## High Level Purpose Statement
I want to further test Spring Boot capabilities by creating an HTML controlled route for a client-server application.

## Experimental Design
I will expand on my previous rock paper scissors game by making a frontend and serving it to the client using Spring Boot technology.

## Resources Available
Spring Boot Docs, Internet

## Time Estimate
2-3 Hours. I will need to learn how to serve static pages.

## Experiment Notes
The project ran with few issues, although I did struggle trying to get Java to recognize the spring boot project to begin with.

## Results
When the server is started, a client can connect and view the frontend page to play a simple game of rock paper scissors with the server. After making their selection via an HTML button, they are routed to the results page which displays the outcome of each game, and tracks the wins.

## Consequences for the Future
I really liked seeing the extendability of spring boot. I took what I had before and expanded on it, adding a library to serve static pages. It didn't get in the way of what I had or require too much restructuring. In the future, I might consider spring boot to use for a project that requires changes over time with what it can do.
